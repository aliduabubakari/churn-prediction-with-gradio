# churn-prediction-with-gradio
This repository contains code and resources for building a churn prediction model using machine learning techniques, and deploying it with Gradio for a user-friendly interface. Gradio is used to create a web interface for the trained model, which allows users to input customer data and get predictions on their likelihood of churning.
